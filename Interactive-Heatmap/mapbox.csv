Meanwhile, an 850mb low was positioned over New Mexico. As the 850mb low moved east across New Mexico on the 29th and 30th, much warmer, moisture-laden air was transported north across the southern plains in a layer approximately 3,000 feet thick, trapping the sub-freezing layer beneath. On the evening of the 30th, the 850mb low crossed the New Mexico/ Texas border. A mid-upper level trough moving east across the southern Rockies provided sufficient lift across the region. Widespread freezing rain and sleet developed late in the afternoon of the 29th across south-central Kansas and continued through the night of the 30th, eventually changing to snow early on the morning of the 31th.

Cumulus over the Ocean, experiment between December 3, 2004, and January 27, 2005, based out of
Antigua.  Hydrogen peroxide is symbolically represented by H2O2.  Methylhydroperoxide is
symbolically given by CH3OOH. The measurements are given as molecular mixing ratios; molecules of
specific gas per molecules of whole air times 1,000,000,000,000. or ppt-v.  The partial pressure
of a specific gas can be calculated by:  P(H2O2) = MixingRatio(pptv) * P(air) /1,000,000,000,000.
<p>
The goal of RICO was a detailed understanding of rain formation in shallow "warm" cumulus clouds
over the ocean.  Objectives included following the number density distributions and chemical
evolution of aerosol, cloud condensation nuclei, cloud droplets, and precipitation.  Sulfur gas
and partcile chemistry leading to sulfate was consider a key process and the measurements of
peroxides are directly related to particulate sulfate formation.
<p>
<b>Updated on 2006/01/03</b> with revised data files:<ul>
 <li> correct lag time errors in CVI to air_sample changes in sample mode (and vice versa).
 <li> Remove H2O2 data during noted periods of inlet condensation; primarily during initial decent after 1st high altitude circle at 5km and 1/2 way through first lower altitude circle.
 <li> Corrected limit of detection of methylhydroperoxide (15 -> 30 ppt) and its estimated uncertainty
